# voleCricle

when running this with vole:
Observations, I have noticed that getting to accurate results when drawing circle will result in error therefore we
must put human error when making the circle. see image: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/563054518934437892/844281082728022097/unknown.png
or https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836686156787744801/844287984571777054/unknown.png. This can be accomplished by 
putting slight resistance on the mouse or slightly shaking as circle is being made.

Steps: 
1. run this on python or on terminal
2. during time deplay swap to vole tab (page)
3. hold mouse button as mouse is automatically readjusted to fit unit circle
4. if circle does not complete rotation finish manually.
